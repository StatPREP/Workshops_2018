# StatPREP Pre-Workshop Homework

In the instructions for [getting ready for the StatPREP workshop](getting_ready.html), we asked participants to think about their statistics course and what they would like to change. Here is a summary of the responses.

## Data Handling

Question: *What do you teach about handling data? (That is, not about the analysis of data but about how data is stored, accessed, transformed.)*

Given that statistics is sometimes described as "the science of data," it's remarkable that ways of storing, accessing, and manipulating/wrangling data are not in the standard curriculum. The participants' answers reflected this. 

- Nothing
- Nothing formal but embedded in class activities
- Missing data, how to make a data sheet
- Sources such as McCabe text, DASL, JMP data sets
- Difficulty of big data.
- Data may not be accurate (entered incorrectly)
- Data tells a story; you need to find that story
- Data ethics
- Copy and paste from web to Excel
- Presenting data graphically
- `read.csv()` & `write.csv()`


**Lesson ideas**: 

- Calculating grade-point-averages for departments or professors by joining tables in a registrar's data base. (`grades.csv`, `courses.csv`, `grade2number.csv` from MOSAIC site.)
- Cleaning inconsistently entered data (e.g. bird species encountered)



## Unsatisfying topics

Question: *Which topics do you find unsatisfying?*

* Descriptive stats (generally they already know this)
    - "rules" for histograms
* Probability:
* Distributions: binomial, uniform, t
* Hypothesis testing
    - Writing H_0 and H_a correctly.
* t, z, ... table mechanics
* Experimental design.

**Lesson Idea**: Sensitivity and specificity of, e.g., medical screening tests, or any classifier. More generally, do conditional probability by actually counting cases from a data set.

## Lessons to improve

Question: *Which lesson have you been aching to improve?*

* Would love to get to ANOVA and chi-square.
* Comparing distributions
* Inferential statistics
* Sampling distributions of mean and proportion
* Medical tests: sensitivity, specificity, pos. predictivity, ...
* Projects, reports, presentations

**Lesson Ideas**: 

- Use distribution Little App to look at NHANES variables, which have a variety of distributions. Talk about *why* the different variables have the distributions they do.
- Use sampling, resampling, shuffling

## Topics to remove

Question: *Suppose you were tasked to develop a version of your statistics course that is only two-thirds as long as your current course. What topics would you drop or consolidate?*

* drop intro material in favor of actual data analysis 
* counting, "unhelpful" probability (Bayes Theorem)
* binomial theorem
* normal approx. to $\hat{p}$ distribution
* consolidate two-sample and multi=sample for quantitative variables.
    *We are "doing the same thing" when we construct CI for $\mu_1$, $\mu_x - \mu_y$, $p_1$, $p_1 - p_2$*
* regression (it gets covered in other courses)
* Detailed explanation of Type I and II errors
* Urn and playing card examples.

**Lesson Idea**: Rather than the "one-way" and "two-way" formulas, ANOVA as a general (and simple) method for studying models, based on the idea of nested models.

## Data examples

Question: *What data sets do you currently use that you would like to give a higher profile? Are there data sets that you'd like to incorporate but haven't had a chance to do so?*

* GAPMINDER (esp. "Dollar Street")
* Consumer complaints, e.g. at `finance.gov` web site.
* CDC data sets
* Datasets for success rates of students in a 4-year college.
* Medical charting
* Kaiser Health (State Health Facts) ... "But I puzzle over using state-level data. I would prefer the unit of observation to be people or fish or something easy for students to understand."
* US Census / American Community Survey
* World Bank data
* Genome data
* Death dates by day of week and day of year.

**Lesson Idea**: 
    - 311 calls for Seattle
    - Dept. of Education scorecard data
    - Voter registration data (e.g. Wake County)
    - Road race data
    - Weather events
    - National Cancer Institute NCI-60 data.
