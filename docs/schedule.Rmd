# Schedule of Workshop Activities

This schedule is intended to be the hub from which you can access notes and activities for the StatPREP 2018 workshops. You might want to bookmark it in your browser so that you can find it quickly.

Note the [HELP!!](help_for_shy_people.html) menu item above. Use it if you're too shy to ask a question out loud. Also use it to help the StatPREP organizers by posting comments, criticisms, suggestions, and such.

6. Evaluation: Help us improve!

7. Going forward ... support and staying in touch

### Explanation

This schedule does not include information about specific timing, breaks, meals, and such. That's because each of the four workshop locations will have slightly different arrangements with respect to those things.

You'll notice that there are three distinct styles of interaction planned for the workshop:

1. Presentations and discussions that are in the style of a class you might teach your own students, but with the workshop participants playing the role of the students.
2. Activities where the participants are preparing lessons for use in their own classrooms.
3. Training and work as data scientists undertaking analysis of data.
