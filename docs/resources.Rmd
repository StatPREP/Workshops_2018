# Resources

* Tutorials for instructors

* Little Apps

* Lessons for use in class

## Textbooks

* The [Open Intro Stats](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) books. There are three books in different styles:

    * Open Intro Statistics
    * Open Intro Stats with Simulation and Randomization
    * Advanced High-School Statistics
    
    The Open Intro books are available free on line and in print form for less than $10. We're going to use them as a source for examples in the tutorials and to illustrate "typical" textbook problems.
