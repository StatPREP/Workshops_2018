# Resources

* Tutorials for instructors

* Little Apps

* Lessons for use in class

* The [Open Intro Stats](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) book. This is available free on line and in print form for less than $10. We're going to use this as a source for examples in the tutorial and to illustrate "typical" textbook problems. It doesn't use MOSAIC, so the R examples are unnecessarily complex.
