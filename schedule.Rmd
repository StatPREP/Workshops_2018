title: "Schedule of Workshop Activities"
---

This schedule is the central collection of links to items that will be used in the StatPREP workshops. Participants should bookmark it in the browser for easy access during the workshop.

This schedule does not include information about specific timing, breaks, meals, and such. That's because each of the four workshop locations will have slightly different arrangements with respect to those things.

You'll notice that there are three distinct styles of interaction planned for the workshop:

1. Presentations and discussions that are in the style of a class you might teach your own students, but with the workshop participants playing the role of the students.
2. Activities where the participants are preparing lessons for use in their own classrooms.
3. Training and work as data scientists undertaking analysis of data.

Schedule items will be marked with an icon indicating which styles are applicable.
